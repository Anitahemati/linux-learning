Key Takeaways

- Bash is a shell that interprets and executes commands.
- PATH determines where executable files are searched for.
- Some commands are shell built-ins (e.g., cd), while others are executable files (e.g., ls).
- Shell variables exist only in the current shell.
- Environment variables can be inherited by child processes.
- Aliases provide shortcuts for frequently used commands.
